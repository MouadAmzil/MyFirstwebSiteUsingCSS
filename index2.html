<div class="DESIGN">
  <div class="pargh2">
    <h2>THE BEACH    </h2>
    <p>Great design is part of the calamander experience.Our objective is to provide world-class beach location.The highlight of our design is our pools and our restaurant.These include the world's first vermillion coloured swimming pool,Sri lanka's first glass fronted pool,and a restaurant designed as a contemporary interpretation of the ancient 'Magul Maduwa', 
      The Royal Audience Hall in Kandy,which has the longest solid timber roof built in Sri Lanka this century.The highlight of our design is our pools and our restaurant. Our Sun Pool is the world’s first vermillion coloured swimming pool, the colour of the Unawatuna sunset, and shimmers with beautiful Italian mosaic tiles. The turtles that lay their eggs on Unawatuna Beach inspired our children’s pool, The Turtle Pool, which is inlaid with a glittering mosaic turtle. Finally,The Blu Pool, Sri Lanka’s first glass fronted pool (and Asia Pacific’s longest) is one of the few pools in the world to sit directly on a famous beach, from which you get a
       beautiful view of the Indian Ocean.</p>
